Order Status Report Generation Tool (OSRG Tool)

The OSRG Tool is short for Order Status Report Generator Tool. In my current position I frequently create order status reports 
for customers or for my own use when managing customer orders. The application makes use of a status file in a .csv file format 
which is generated by one of my organizations business systems. The application strips away unnecessary data, and formats it in 
a more useful excel spreadsheet format. It is currently written in Java, and I may consider re-implementing it in C# in the future.
